      <p className="text-maroon/90 leading-relaxed">
        Raksha Bandhan, also known as Rakhi, is a significant Hindu festival that celebrates the pure bond of love between a brother and a sister. The festival is observed on the full moon day of the Hindu month of Shravana. On this day, a sister ties a sacred thread, or 'rakhi,' on her brother's wrist, symbolizing her love and prayers for his well-being, while the brother, in return, offers a promise to protect her.

        Traditions include exchanging gifts, sharing sweets, and offering heartfelt wishes and blessings. Over time, Raksha Bandhan has evolved to celebrate the spirit of care, trust, and togetherness among siblings and loved ones, regardless of gender.
